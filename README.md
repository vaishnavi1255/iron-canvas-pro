**Description**



Iron Canvas Pro is an AI based gesture drawing application built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.  

It allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using real time hand gestures captured through a webcam.



The system detects hand landmarks, interprets finger movements, and converts them into smooth digital strokes with interactive UI elements and visual effects.



This project demonstrates practical implementation of:

\- Computer Vision

\- Gesture Recognition

\- Real time Image Processing

\- Human Computer Interaction
